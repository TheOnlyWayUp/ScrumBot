# ScrumBot
A ScrumBot for daily standups for Discord.
It uses the ReplitDB because I was feeling a bit lazy, anyway if you want to host on your own VPS just use the ![proxy](https://replit.com/@util/Replit-Database-proxy) and set the webpage's url as your $REPLIT_DB_URL's, or you can change some functions to just use another database/json file. Sorry for the inconvenience in that case.
